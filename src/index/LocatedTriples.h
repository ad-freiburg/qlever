// DEFINITION OF THE POSITION OF A LOCATED TRIPLE IN A PERMUTATION
//
// 1. The position is defined by the index of a block.
//
// 2. A triple belongs to the first block (with the smallest index) that also
// contains at least one triple that is larger than or equal to the input
// triple.
//
// 2.1. In particular, if the triple falls "between two blocks" (the last triple
// of the previous block is smaller and the first triple of the next block is
// larger), then the block is the next block.
//
// 2.2. In particular, if the triple is smaller than all triples in the
// permutation, the position is the first position of the first block.
//
// 3. If the triple is larger than all triples in the permutation, the block
// index is one after the largest block index.
