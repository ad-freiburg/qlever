/**
 * @brief convert a RDF Literal to a unified form that is used inside QLever.
 * Inputs that are no literals (are not surrounded by ', ", ''' or """) will
 * trigger an exception
 *
 * RDFLiterals in Turtle or Sparql can have several forms: They may either
 * be surrounded with one (" or ') quotation mark and contain all special
 * characters in escaped form, like "\\\t". Alternatively literals may be
 * surrounded by three (""" or ''') quotation marks. Then escapes are still
 * allowed, but several special characters (e.g. '\n' or '\t' may be contained
 * directly in the string (For details, see the Turtle or Sparql standard).
 *
 * This function converts any of these forms to a literal that starts and ends
 * with a single quotation mark ("content") and contains the originally escaped
 * characters directly, e.g. "al\"pha" becomes "al"pha".
 *
 * This is NOT a valid RDF form of literals, but this format is only used
 * inside QLever.
