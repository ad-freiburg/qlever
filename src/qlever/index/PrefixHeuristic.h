// A simple greedy algorithm the calculates prefixes of a given vocabulary which
// are suitable for compression.
//
// Arguments: vocabulary  - the vocabulary we want to compress, must be sorted
//                          ascending alphabetically
//            numPrefixes - the number of prefixes we want to compute
//            codelength  - the (fixed) length of the code for the prefixes we
//                          want the algorithm to assume.
// Returns:   vector of suitable  prefixes  which have been selected by the
//            algorthm
//

// A simple greedy algorithm the calculates prefixes of a given vocabulary which
// are suitable for compression.
//
// Arguments: filename    - path to a file from which the vocabulary is read.
//                          Must be one word per line and sorted ascending
//                          alphabetically
//            numPrefixes - the number of prefixes we want to compute
//            codelength  - the (fixed) length of the code for the prefixes we

//            alwaysAddCode - this means that a encoding of size codelength will
//                            be added to every word, no matter if it is
//                            actually compressed. (This is true for the
//                            vocabulary in QLever). The Algorithm has to know
//                            this in order to chosse the correct prefixes.
