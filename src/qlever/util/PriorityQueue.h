 * operations Both of them can be used as the first template parameter to the
 * ad_utility::FlexibleCache class template
 *
 * HeapBasedPQ is based on a heap(std::priority_queue). UpdateKey will cause
 * duplicates in the internal data structure which might make later pop
 * operations more expensive
 *
 * TreeBasedPQ is based on a balanced tree (std::multiset). It has stronger
 * asymptotic guarantees, but the constant factor of the log(n) operations might
 * be bigger because of the more complex tree structure
