# Introduction
A quick introduction and tutorial for the macro benchmark infrastructure.

As of the `8.4.2023` the benchmark infrastructure has the following features:  
- Measuring the execution time of a function in seconds.
- Organizing a benchmark as a single measurement, as a group of single measurements, or as a table of measurements.
- Printing the measured benchmarks and/or exporting them as a JSON formatted file.
- Adding metadata information to benchmarks. This information will not be printed, but it will be in an exported JSON file.
