          # entry is missing, then the images for each platform are considered seperate.
          # If this action runs on a single runner (i.e. the attribute `platforms`
          # contains a list of all platforms) then the manifest is configured automatically.
          # If the build and push is split over multiple runners, then the action requires an additional `merge`
          # job, which merges the images for each platform into a single multiplatform image.
