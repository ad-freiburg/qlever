# This workflow runs as soon as the workflow from `code-coverage.yml` has
# successfully finished. It downloads the created artifact and runs the
# Codecov uploader. This workflow uses the `workflow_run` trigger. This
# means that it will always be run from the master branch, meaning that
# the contents of this file will always be taken from the master branch,
# even if a PR changes it. Since this approach disallows several attacks
# from malicious PR authors, such workflows have access to the secrets
# stored on GitHub. For details on the `workflow_run` trigger and this
# security measures, see
