# Measure the code coverage of QLever's unit tests using LLVMs source
# instrumentation. When this workflow runs for the master branch, the
# coverage report is directly uploaded to Codecov.io. When this workflow
# runs for a pull request, the coverage report is stored as a GitHub artifact
# and a separate workflow from `upload-coverage.yml` is triggered that uploads
# the coverage report. That way the uploader has access to the Codecov token
# in all cases and the upload should never fail.

# The following name has to be the same as in the `workflows:` key in
# `upload-coverage.yml`, otherwise the uploader won't pick up the result
# of this workflow.
